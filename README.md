# ViA - Computer Vision

This project is a React application that implements several computer vision algorithms using TensorFlow.js. It enables real-time face detection, hand pose detection, and facial landmarks detection.

## Features

- Real-time face detection
- Hand pose detection
- Facial landmarks detection
- Intuitive user interface

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (version 6 or higher)
- A modern web browser with WebGL support

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [REPO_URL]
cd ViA_Computer-Vision-Algorithms
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Project

To start the application in development mode:

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Technologies Used

- React
- TensorFlow.js
- BlazeFace for face detection
- MediaPipe for hand pose detection
- Face Landmarks Detection for facial landmarks
